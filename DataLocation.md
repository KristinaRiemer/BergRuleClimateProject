Searching for appropriate data set for project

Requirements:
------------
Multiple individuals/populations of a single species
Body mass for individuals/populations
Sufficient temporal resolution (50+ years)
Sufficient spatial resolution (continent-wide?)


* GBIF: only occurrence data, no mass/body size information

* Berkeley Museum data via Ecoengine API (http://ropensci.org/blog/2014/01/29/ecoengine/ ), no mass/body size information? 

* Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at Berkely via Berkeley Museum API, no mass/body size information, but itâ€™s difficult to use their collections search (http://mvz.berkeley.edu/Mammal_Collection.html )

Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History collections via Hallgrimsson & Maiorana (1999), should have body mass, but how to filter by that? Looked at mammal collection (http://collections.nmnh.si.edu/search/mammals/ ). Have mass and location (lat & long) info for some. Can export data as CSV. 

* how many witih mass 
* how many with decimal degrees (Lat / Long)
* how many with county level or more specific locality info (need county)
* how many with mass and locaality
* distribution of years
* spatial extent


Search terms: mass, weight, body size, body length
