Data
=====

Goal: Find appropriate data set for project

Requirements:
-------------
* Multiple individuals/populations of a single species
* Body mass for individuals/populations
* Sufficient temporal resolution (50+ years)
* Sufficient spatial resolution (continent-wide?)



Possible datasets:
--------------
* GBIF: only occurrence data, no mass/body size information
http://www.gbif.org/occurrence

* Berkeley Museum data via Ecoengine API, no mass/body size information? 
http://ropensci.org/blog/2014/01/29/ecoengine/

* Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at Berkely via Berkeley Museum API, no mass/body size information, but itâ€™s difficult to use their collections search 
http://mvz.berkeley.edu/Mammal_Collection.html

* Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History collections via Hallgrimsson & Maiorana (1999), should have body mass, but how to filter by that? Looked at mammal collection. Have mass and location (lat & long) info for some. Can export data as CSV. 
Mammal collection: http://collections.nmnh.si.edu/search/mammals/ 

* The LTER database was recommended by Morgan 3/21/14. Haven't looked at it much yet.

R code exploration:
----------------
Purpose: find a species with a sufficient number of individuals from the Smithsonian database by importing CSV files into R and looking for # of occurrences of following things:
* how many with mass 
* how many with decimal degrees (Lat / Long)
* how many with county level or more specific locality info (need county)
* how many with mass and locaality
* distribution of years
* spatial extent


Possible species:

List from Morgan, email 3/24/14

1. _Peromyscus maniculatus_
Done:
  * In NMNH database, search for Scientific Name ("Peromyscus maniculatus"), Country ("United States"), Measurements ("Weight"); got 1000+ hits
  * Export as CSV
  * Filter list using "Data Collected" column according to oldest to newest. Date range: 1919-2011
  * Size or location: Determine how many hits have mass (282), latitude (32), county (915)
  * Size and location: Have 282 specimens that have mass and county or latitude info
  * Spatial spread: Create map that shades in counties that have specimens
To do:
  * Need to determine temporal spread
  * Need to determine if temporal plus spatial spread is sufficient, e.g., can't have only data from 50 years ago in a single location
  * Change county into latitude and longitude (use Google Maps to do this, "georeferencing")
  * Incorporate specimens from outside United States--300 specimens from Canada and Mexico.
2. _Dipodomys ordii_
3. _Sciurus carolinensis_
4. _Tamiasciurus hudsonicus_
5. _Tamias striatus_
