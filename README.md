#### Purpose
To determine if there is an intraspecific relationship between mass and temperature for many animals species at broad temporal and spatial scales. This is motivated by the prediction that animal species will respond to climate change with body size shifts. 

Also of interest is if temperatures from years before individuals are collected (temporal lag; TL) are better at explaining mass variation than the temperature from the collection year (current year; CY).  

#### Datasets
* Individual mass: [Vertnet museum compilation](http://vertnet.org/), from which trait data were extracted by Rob Guralnick, et al. 
  * Initially used mass data from [Smithsonian mammal collections](http://collections.nmnh.si.edu/search/mammals/)
* Temperature: monthly mean temperature data in a raster format going back to 1900 from [NOAA/University of Delaware](http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.UDel_AirT_Precip.html)
