### Current Project Summary

Gordon Conference 2014 project (complete):
Determined relationship between mass and temperature for xx mammal species in the United States. Used average July temperature for each individual's collection year. 

Temporal scaling/lag project (in progress):
This is intended to subsume and replace the previous project. Will determine relationship between mass and temperature for mammal species in the US, with possibility of expanding beyond the US and repeating analysis for non-mammal taxa. Currently using average July temperatures for each individual's collection year and each year previous until 1900, which is a yearly summer month lag.
